# **Clean with SQL**

## **Goal**

## **Turn the messy raw table (equipment_failures_raw) into a clean, analysis-ready table — without ever overwriting the raw data, so the before/after transformation is always visible in the portfolio.**

## **What I did**

  1. De-duplicated records, keeping the most complete row per duplicate group.
  2. Standardized resolved into a clean boolean/enum.
  3. Normalized part_affected spellings to a lookup table of real part names.
  4. Parsed date_reported from mixed formats into a single DATE type.
  5. Corrected/flagged negative downtime_hours and estimated_cost_zar values.
  6.Converted blank fields to proper NULLs and decided how to handle each.
